# Seoul-Bike-Sharing
The research of Urban Mobility applies Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to predict the demand for hourly bicycle rentals using the ‘Seoul Bike Sharing Demand’ dataset. GPR being a Bayesian, non-parametric machine learning (ML) model proficient in recognizing intricate patterns and quantifying uncertainty. The study goes through the effectiveness of GPR employing five different kernel functions. The dataset includes hourly records for an entire year, featuring twelve meteorological and seasonal factors in addition to the target variable, "Rented Bike Count". Kernel comparison following data cleaning and normalization: Radial Basis Function (RBF), Matern (with v=1.5 and v=2.5), DotProduct in conjunction with RBF, and a composite of RBF with ExpSineSquared. The study weighs Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² score to evaluate each model trained on a scaled subset of 1000 samples. The kernel DotProduct combined with the RBF produced the best result with values of R² = 0.7493, MSE = 0.0072, and MAE = 0.0555.
